Before the pandemic, I was planning on leaving Florida. I'm likely to be here for some time now, though. So far, I haven't gotten sick, but many people I care about have. The world is a frightening place these days.

I'm continuing to revise my novel. I have a complete draft, but there's a lot of work left to get it to be as polished as I would like it to be. I'm finished with the part where I have to work on it extensively.

I've been migrating to a mostly self-hosted setup, for code, files, and social media. I'm beginning to work on figuring out what I'm comfortable sharing and not sharing, and what to include on this website.
