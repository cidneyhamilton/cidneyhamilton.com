## About This Site

This is my realname domain! I've registered it so that other people can't pretend to be me, and that it's easy to contact me. :) It's a very simple static site without much real content, though lately I've been starting to <a href="/blog">blog</a> about stuff and keep general information up to date.

I try to redesign it once a year just for fun. For the end of 2021, I'm seeing if I can get away with getting rid of CSS altogether, so I don't have to worry about styling. :)

## Elsewhere

I don't use corporate social media. It makes me more mysterious and less prone to distraction. If you're on the fediverse, I host my own <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">mastodon</a> instance, where you can follow me at <a href="{{ site.fedi-url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.fedi-url }}</a>. (If you're not on the fediverse, sign up for an account and follow me anyways; decentralized social media is cool. I host some of my games, including things for gamejams, at <a href="{{ site.itch-url }}" target="_blank">{{ site.itch-url }}</a>, and some of my source code at <a href="http://git.city-of-glass.net/gitea">my personal git forge</a> and <a href="{{ site.github-url }}">github for open source stuff</a>.
