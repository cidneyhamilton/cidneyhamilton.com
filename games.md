I make video games! Mostly with Unity, though I've also done some indie stuff with Godot, Inform, or just my own code. I'm a fan of free and open source gamedev tools for narrative design, such as Ink and Twine.

I'm primarily a programmer, but I've also done 2D and 3D art, animation, music composition, game design, script writing, sound, voice acting... all the things.

Some commercial games I've worked or am working on:

* [a new secret game with Ken and Roberta Williams](http://kensgame.com)
* [Summer Daze at Hero-U](https://summerdazegame.com)
* [Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption](http://hero-u.com)

My indie stuff is available on [itch.io]({{ site.itch-url }})
