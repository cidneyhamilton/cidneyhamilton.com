Curious about the tools I work with? They're listed here. This was inspired by <a href="http://uses.tech">uses.tech</a>.

## Programming Languages

* I'm primarily developing in C#, with Unity, these days.
* I use Ink and GDScript (for Godot) for side projects.
* Ruby (for web development, inclulding this website!); plus HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Plus lots of others that I use less frequently.

### Software

I develop on Linux (using Ubuntu Studio). I use other platforms primarily for testing.

I use Emacs for programming, creative writing, and technical writing. Since I'm primarily developing with Unity when making games with other people, and Unity is built around C# and a Microsoft dev environment, I've had to jump through some hoops to get it working.

I prefer to use free software for multimedia; though I got started with Adobe in school. For graphics, I mostly Krita and Blender, plus Aseprite for pixel art, and GIMP, Inkscape, and Scribus as needed. I've begun composing my own music and recording my sound effects for gamejams, but have been reliant on an older Mac with Garageband to work with my digital piano and get sound into the game efficiently.

### Hardware

I use a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium for drawing and painting. I have a Lenovo Legion Y-720 for game development, and an Oculus Quest 2 for VR testing.
