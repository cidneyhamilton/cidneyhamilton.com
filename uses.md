Curious about the tools I work with? They're listed here. This was inspired by <a href="http://uses.tech">uses.tech</a>.

## Programming Languages

* JavaScript (client and server-side), plus other ECMAScript derivatives
* Python, Ruby, PHP, for server-side things
* LISP (elisp and Scheme)
* C-like languages: C, C++, Java, and C#

I've written code in Ocaml, ML, and Assembly in school, but not since then. :)

### Editor

I use Emacs for programming, creative writing, and technical writing! I am pretty comfortable with it, though there's still plenty I have left to learn.

I prefer to use free software for multimedia; though I got started with Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign and still am probably more efficient in those. For graphics, I use Krita for 2D (falling back to GIMP when needed), and Blender for 3D. I use Audacity for sound editing and ffmpeg for video editing.

### Hardware

I use a Wacom Intuos Pro Medium for drawing and painting. I have a Lenovo Legion Y-720 for game development, plus an ancient ThinkPad and MacBook Pro for testing and dealing with Mac gatekeeping. I have a digital piano and microphone for sound.

### GNU/Linux Distribution

I use Ubuntu Studio (with KDE Plasma). Recommend for designers/creatives. 

### Phones

I have an iPhone 6. Before that I had an iPhone 3. Both were gifts. I rarely use them. I've been curious about getting a Fairphone for a while, but it'll be a while before my current phone dies.

### Game Engines

I'm most familiar with Unity for graphics and physics, though I'm quite fond of Godot. I've used Unreal somewhat but don't much care for it. 

### Interactive Fiction

I've used Inform (6 and 7), Twine, TADS, and Ink. Ink is BY FAR my favorite format for branching narratives; it's elegant and readable by humans and computers.
