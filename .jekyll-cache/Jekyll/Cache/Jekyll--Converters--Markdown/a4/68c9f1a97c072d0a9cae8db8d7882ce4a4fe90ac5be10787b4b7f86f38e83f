I"\<p><small>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank">now page</a>, inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>. It’s like a static version of a status update.</small></p>

<p>I have a wife now! Cat and I got handfasted in early November, at a nature preserve near where we live. Because of complicated family dynamics, we kept things very small. We’re planning a separate reception for our families in the near future.</p>

<p>I’m still working on the VR port of <a href="http://kensgame.com" target="_blank">Ken Williams’ new game</a>. It’s actively moving along; check out <a href="https://cygnusentertainment.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ken’s blog</a> for updates. I’m focused on user interface development right now and working closely with Roberta Williams; things are coming along nicely, and I can’t wait for people to be able to play it.</p>

<p>Ken recently started a new company– Cygnus Entertainment– and hired two technical artists and one programmer, all of whom have been helping out with my project. I’d been working seven day weeks and getting very stressed out, so it’s good to have more help and be able to take weekends off without needing to provide technical support.</p>

<p>My wife has taken over the house tabletop game. I’d decided to adapt an old Gary Gygax module for my group (Cat and our roommate, Nick), and got them through Gary Gygax’s The Village of Hommlet, first published in 1979, ported to my homebrew campaign setting. Cat is now having us playtest a module she’s written for the same campaign setting, based on Mussorgsky (and Walt Disney’s) Night on Bald Mountain. I’m playing a Serbian Jew and self-taught wizard living in Belgrade in 999, currently on a mission to investigate a haunting in a local village, but knowing Cat can expect things to progress into something more apocalyptic soon. We have a <a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/NightOnBaldMountain/HomePage" target="_blank">campaign wiki</a> I’m trying to keep up to date.</p>

<p>I was optimistically hoping to do another draft of my novel for NaNoWriMo, but have had zero time. I’m focusing aggressively on tying up loose ends and getting my life in order, so I can make the most of nights and weekends and have time to finish the book. Getting some downtime has been good; but going back to it has been discouraging (“wait, I <em>wrote</em> this? this is terrible!”).</p>

<p>I made it to EmacsConf last weekend, which was a lot of fun. In college we had to do our problem sets in emacs, but once I graduated I ended up using the IDEs everyone else was using at work to reduce friction (I had a BA in computer science from a liberal arts college, and considered myself lucky to get an engineering job at all!). I ended up switching back to emacs a couple years ago to finish my novel; it takes <a href="https://elizadev.medium.com/using-unity-editor-with-emacs-9316eb441411" target="_blank"> some fiddling</a> to get it usable in Unity, but is well worth it. I still have a LOT to learn, though, and often feel daunted by how different my background is than most people’s!</p>

<p>I’m still on the fediverse, though I check fairly infrequently. Feel free to message me there if you want to connect or geek out!</p>
