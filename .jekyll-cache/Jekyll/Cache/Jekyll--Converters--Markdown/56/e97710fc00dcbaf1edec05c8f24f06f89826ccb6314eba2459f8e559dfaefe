I"¢<p>Before the pandemic, I was planning on leaving Florida. Iâ€™m likely to be here for some time now, though. So far, I havenâ€™t gotten sick, but many people I care about have. The world is a frightening place these days.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m continuing to revise my novel. I have a complete draft, but thereâ€™s a lot of work left to get it to be as polished as I would like it to be. Iâ€™m finished with the part where I have to work on it extensively.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been migrating to a mostly self-hosted setup, for code, files, and social media. Iâ€™m beginning to work on figuring out what Iâ€™m comfortable sharing and not sharing, and what to include on this website.</p>
