  My real first name is <a class="p-name u-url" href="http://localhost:4000"><span class="p-given-name">Cidney</span></a>. I mostly have been making narrative games these days; but I've also been a software engineer, graphic designer, and various other roles as needed. I'm a queer vegan Millennial snowflake. I live in the Eastern US and seem to collect cats.

<h2 id="about-this-site">About This Site</h2>

<p>This is my realname domain! Iâ€™ve registered it so that other people canâ€™t pretend to be me, and that itâ€™s easy to contact me. :) Itâ€™s a very simple static site without much real content.</p>

<h2 id="elsewhere">Elsewhere</h2>

<p>I donâ€™t use corporate social media. It makes me more mysterious and less prone to distraction. If youâ€™re on the fediverse, I host my own mastodon instance, where you can follow me at <a href="https://social.city-of-glass.net/@cidney" target="_blank">https://social.city-of-glass.net/@cidney</a>. I host some of my games, including things for gamejams, at <a href="https://cidney.itch.io" target="_blank">https://cidney.itch.io</a></p>
