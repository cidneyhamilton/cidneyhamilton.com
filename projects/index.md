## Game Development

This is a non-exhaustive list of games I've worked on.

<p><a href="http://summerdazegame.com" target="_blank">Summer Daze at Hero-U</a> is a light-hearted choose-your-own-adventure style story set at Hero University. Play as Tilly Appleberry, a mischievous Rogue, or as Ifeyo Kinah, a studious Wizarding student. Background and character art by John Paul Selwood; story and dialogue by Corey and Lori Cole.</p>

<p>
<a href="http://hero-u.com" target="_blank">Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption</a> puts you in the shoes of Shawn O'Connor, an aspiring thief. Caught red-handed after a break-in attempt, Shawn is given two choices: go to jail, or go to "reform school" at Hero University. The player is challenged to balance dungeon exploration, lessons, and making friends with uncovering the mysteries behind the school itself.
