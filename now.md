## What I'm Doing Now

<small>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a>. It serves in lieu of a status update.</small>

I'm quaranting in **Melbourne, Florida**, while finishing up my physical therapy protocol. I've fully recovered from my spine injury: most of the time, I look and feel normal.

My partner just finished nursing school, and we're both waiting until we can move. I've enjoyed being closer to my family while recovering, but I don't enjoy the political climate of Florida at all, and it's difficult to not live in a tech hub.

I'm still working on [Summer Daze at Hero-U](http://summerdazegame.com) with [Lori and Corey Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coles). The game will be released later this year, once the writer finishes up her script. :) I'm starting on a new project, details to be announced soon!
