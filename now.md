## What I'm Doing Now

<small>This is a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about">now page</a>, inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/nowff">Derek Sivers</a>'s. It's like a static version of a status update.</small>

I'm... writing a book!

I've been in Florida for the last three years. Originally, I was here to renew my visa and go back to Paris. Then I ended up having another two rounds of spine surgery (turns out there were complications after a car accident). Then, discovered that my biological mother had been conducting real estate fraud in my name (ouch), and I was both disabled and owed a lot of taxes on a business I wasn't involved in.

It was a complicated and personally difficult few years. 

My plan has always been to wrap things up, then move back up north... but the events of the last few years have reached the point where I struggle to talk about them because I figure nobody will believe me. :) Florida is a really weird place, and my life has been really weird in general.

So... I'm writing a novel! It deals with sex trafficking, the weirder side of Florida, teen suicide, and personal agency. It'll be coming out in early 2021.
